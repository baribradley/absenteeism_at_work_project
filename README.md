# absenteeism_at_work_project
In this repository I use Python, SQL and Tableau together to address absenteeism at a company during work time.

In this exercise, I use a logistic regression model to predict whether an employee will be excessively absent from work. Then I create a custom module to preprocess and model new data, create a table with the new observations in SQL, then visualize the observations in Tableau.

Purpose of this business exercise: Explore whether an employee presenting certain characteristics is expected to be away from work for a certain amount of time or not.
